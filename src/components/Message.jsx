                The university was established to impart knowledge to human
                beings to develop a human society with wisdom. However, in the
                era of ICT/Internet, the role of universities has diversified
                substantially. Now, universities have to fulfill their
                commitment in the fast-changing environment of this millennium.
                Therefore, placement records and placement prospects have become
                one of the more important parameters for the success of
                universities and their departments, which need to strengthen
                dynamically.
              </p>
              <p>
                I feel proud of the Department of Computer Science, which has
                been conscious and sensitive to these matters. It has not only
                restructured its courses thoroughly to incorporate the latest
                and the best but also appointed a Placement Committee led by a
                Professor to improve placement prospects for the current and
                forthcoming batches. I am also happy to recognize Dr. Suraiya
                Jabin’s dynamic leadership, as she is directly involved in
                placement-related activities. The university-level placement
                team led by Dr. Rahela Farooqi is also striving hard for the
                same goal. Therefore, I have no hesitation in stating that it
                will bring marvelous results for the benefit of our professional
                students of the Master of Computer Applications program.
              </p>
              <p>
                I invite all concerned industries to help us strengthen our
                campus placement efforts by selecting our students as
                professionals, thereby giving them opportunities to contribute
                positively towards their industrial goals and at the same time
                allowing them to grow. I wish them success in their future
                endeavors.

                The era of globalization, coupled with the advent of information
                technology (IT) and the impetus of the internet, has brought up
                a sea change in the corporate governance and thinking process of
                the human mind, especially in the current millennium. I am
                pleased to share that the Department Of Computer Science under
                the Faculty of Natural Science produces quality professionals in
                the field of IT. In addition to a 2 years post-graduate program,
                Master Of Computer Application (MCA), the Department is
                successfully running a PGDCA and a post-graduate professional
                degree course, M.Sc. (Bioinformatics) through a well-designed
                fundamental industry-oriented curriculum.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am sure that the dedication and commitment of the student to
                the skills developed with these courses, would contribute highly
                towards national development by placing themselves in the
                various industries and educational institutions, both
                domestically and internationally. The mission of producing able
                and competent IT and Bioinformatics professionals in the
                department is being achieved due to the involvement of highly
                dedicated and experienced faculty members. I hope they will
                continue to produce worthy professionals to fulfil the
                industrial and educational needs of the nation.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this objective, I certainly would like to invite all
                esteemed and relevant organizations and companies to induct our
                students as competent professionals that would eventually enable
                them to make a profound impact in this industry as well as at a
                global level.

                The Indian economy is considered one of the fastest-growing and
                emerging economies in recent times. The major reason behind the
                same is the strength of its human resource. Being the second
                most populated country in the world, India can reach greater
                heights if its human resource is utilized appropriately, both by
                the government as well as individuals and institutions. And one
                such measure is the provision of qualitative education of the
                highest standard from any measurable angle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Institutions of higher learning such as Jamia Millia Islamia, a
                Central University, are committed to the task of bridging this
                gap. In this endeavour, the Department of Computer Science, JMI
                has enriched its programs through a complete overhauling of
                course structure, taking into account the contemporary
                requirements of the industry.

                We have a strong placement team with an experienced senior

                life’s journey for them as well as future generations. The
                Department boasts of availability of the state of the art
                infrastructure as well as highly motivated and qualified faculty
                members and staff to guide the youth, which in turn has also

                companies/organization they joined in the recent past. We have
                witnessed these students achieve greater heights in their life
                from trainees to CEOs to Entrepreneurs. I am certain that our

                the gap between industry requirements and a student’s career.
                Our past records are extremely good but the best is yet to come.
                The Programmes/Courses run by our department are job-oriented
                which not only impart higher knowledge but also make one
                competitive at the global level.

              <p>
                As India is already one of the leaders in producing skilled
                manpower in the software industry, our Department adds one more
                feather to this cap. To keep abreast with the latest Development
                in IT and Bio-informatics, the Department organizes workshops
                and extension lectures to boost the knowledge as well as the
                morale of the students. Here students are given independent
                projects to work on to explore their skills, and abilities and
                also act as tools for self judgement. A joint smooth programme
                is made with the central TPO of the University and the Placement
                Committee of the Department. The Department also organizes
                motivational lectures for the student on placement from time to
                time. This gives the student an idea of how to face an interview
                and other selection tests in the corporate sector by which we
                can produce better results.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Placement Programme of the Department normally starts with
                the visits to industries just after the end of even semester
                examination. However, this year, considering the current
                situation, I welcome you to participate in our Virtual Campus
                Placement Programme. The placement brochure contains the student
                profile details. I request you to kindly let us know your plan
                to visit our Department(DCS). Looking forward to a fruitful
