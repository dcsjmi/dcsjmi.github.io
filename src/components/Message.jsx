                                The university was established to impart knowledge to human beings to develop a
                                human society with wisdom. However, in the era of ICT/Internet, the role of universities
                                has diversified substantially. Now, universities have to fulfil their commitment in the
                                fast-changing environment of this era of the millennium. Therefore, placement records
                                and placement prospects became on the more important parameter for the success of
                                the universities and their departments which need to strengthen dynamically. I feel
                                proud of the Department of Computer Science and it has been conscious and sensitive
                                in these matters. It has not only restructured its courses thoroughly to incorporate the
                                latest and the best, but also appointed a Placement Committee lead of a Professor rank
                                to improve placement prospects for the current and the forthcoming batches. I am
                                also happy to get acquainted with Dr Suraiya Jabin’s dynamic leadership, who herself
                                is involved directly in the placement related activities. The university level placement
                                team led by Dr Zainul Abdin Jaffery is also striving hard for the same goal. Therefore,
                                I have no hesitation to state that it will bring marvellous results for the benefit of our
                                professional students of the of Master of Computer Application.

                                efforts by selecting our student as professionals, thereby giving them opportunities to
                                contribute positively towards their industrial goals and at the same time allow them to
                                grow themselves as well. I wish them success in their future endeavours.

                                The era of globalization, coupled with the advent of information technology (IT) and
                                the impetus of the internet, has brought up a sea change in the corporate governance
                                and thinking process of the human mind, especially in the current millennium. I
                                am pleased to share that the Department Of Computer Science under the Faculty of
                                Natural Science produces quality professionals in the field of IT. In addition to a 2 years
                                post-graduate program, Master Of Computer Application (MCA), the Department is
                                successfully running a PGDCA and a post-graduate professional degree course, M.Sc.
                                (Bioinformatics) through a well-designed fundamental industry-oriented curriculum.

                                I am sure that the dedication and commitment of the student to the skills developed
                                with these courses, would contribute highly towards national development by placing
                                themselves in the various industries and educational institutions, both domestically and
                                internationally. The mission of producing able and competent IT and Bioinformatics
                                professionals in the department is being achieved due to the involvement of highly
                                dedicated and experienced faculty members. I hope they will continue to produce
                                worthy professionals to fulfil the industrial and educational needs of the nation.

                                organizations and companies to induct our students as competent professionals that
                                would eventually enable them to make a profound impact in this industry as well as

                            <p>The Indian economy is considered one of the fastest-growing and emerging economies in recent times. The major reason behind the same is the strength of its human resource. Being the second most populated country in the world, India can reach greater heights if its human resource is utilized appropriately, both by the government as well as individuals and institutions. And one such measure is the provision of qualitative education of the highest standard from any measurable angle.</p>
                            <p>Institutions of higher learning such as Jamia Millia Islamia, a Central University, are committed to the task of bridging this gap. In this endeavour, the Department of Computer Science, JMI has enriched its programs through a complete overhauling of course structure, taking into account the contemporary requirements of the industry.</p>
                            <p>We have a strong placement team with an experienced senior professor at the helm, to guide the talented youth by providing direction to attain the right placements which will smoothen life’s journey for them as well as future generations. The Department boasts of availability of the state of the art infrastructure as well as highly motivated and qualified faculty members and staff to guide the youth, which in turn has also been reflected in the overall performance of the students.</p>
                            <p>I, personally, take pleasure in inviting industry to take the opportunity of availing the best of the brains for an individual as well the corporate world and, thereby, being a part of national development.</p>

                                industry, our Department adds one more feather to this cap. To keep abreast with the
                                latest Development in IT and Bio-informatics, the Department organizes workshops and
                                extension lectures to boost the knowledge as well as the morale of the students. Here students
                                are given independent projects to work on to explore their skills, and abilities and also
                                act as tools for self judgement. A joint smooth programme is made with the central TPO
                                of the University and the Placement Committee of the Department. The Department also
                                organizes motivational lectures for the student on placement from time to time. This gives
                                the student an idea of how to face an interview and other selection tests in the corporate
                                sector by which we can produce better results.

                                The Placement Programme of the Department normally starts with the visits to
                                industries just after the end of even semester examination. However, this year, considering
                                the current situation, I welcome you to participate in our Virtual Campus Placement
                                Programme. The placement brochure contains the student profile details. I request you to
                                kindly let us know your plan to visit our Department(DCS). Looking forward to a fruitful
                                association.
